// Aritmetic Operators
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

console.log("a =", a , " & b =", b);
console.log("a + b =", a + b);
console.log("a - b =", a - b);
console.log("a * b =", a * b);
console.log("a / b =", a / b);
console.log("a % b =", a % b); // Gives remainder and is called modulus
console.log("a ** b =", a**b); /* Exponentation like 5 to power 
of 2 */

// Unary Operators 
a++; // Is called increment and increases value by 1 
a--; // Is called decrement and decreases value by 1
console.log(a);
/* ++a and --a are also valid and are called pre increment/
decrement and a++ and a-- are called post increment / decrement
